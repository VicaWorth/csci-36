# WELCOME TO THE DATABASE FOLDER!

This folder contains the code files that will structure and fill the database that holds information collected by the scraper. 
The models are created by the files in the model's folder. These models contain datatypes, primary keys, and other information necessary to create the 
tables for the database. Sequilize then imports the models to create and fill tables for the website and structure the database. 
The database then imports the tables created by sequlize and uses them as the framework when filling the database.
