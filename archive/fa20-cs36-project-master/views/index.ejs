<h3 class="text-light py-2">Project Summary</h3>
<p class="text-light">This is a website that collects information off the Butte College
    website about the different programs and their SLOs and PLOs. It displays the
    information in a easy to understand format and you can look up specific
    programs by their name. You can also look up infomation by department. It will also 
    be able to track the last time a program was assessed and send out an email to the 
    person that assesses that particular program when it is time to assess again.
