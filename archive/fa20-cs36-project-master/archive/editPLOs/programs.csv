136;Geographic Information Systems;The discipline of Geography studies the spatial relationships that make every place on earth unique.  This includes both the physical characteristics and cultural traditions, along with the economic and governmental structures that make each place distinct.   Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and geospatial technology are among the fastest growing fields according to the US Department of Labor. A certificate in GIS provides the student with the proficiency necessary to apply spatial thinking to analyze social and physical sciences information, helping to build better and more sustainable connections between humans and the environment. GIS careers can be standalone and are also found in nearly every field of discipline, from law enforcement to health care and from environmental sciences to business and marketing. Having a working knowledge of GIS, whether a single course or a certificate, will make your resume stand out from the competition. GIS coursework develops critical skills such as organizational and communicational competency, identification and solving of problems, analysis and interpretation, and a high level of computer expertise.   A GIS certificate provides a catalyst for a wide range of fields, including business and marketing, local and regional planning, environmental sciences, law enforcement, conservation, and all levels of government.
