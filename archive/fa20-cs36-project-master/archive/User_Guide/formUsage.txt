To begin editing a PLO using the internal form (in alpha - may not work as expected!):

After completing the steps in the Installation guide

1) Navigate to the folder where you installed slo_scraper
2) Navigate to "editPLOs" folder
3) Run the "userFormDriver.exe" file by doubling clicking it
4) In the window that appeared, navigate through the Menus based on objective
    Notes: Follow the instructions exactly
         * The "#" column holds the number corresponding to a specific selection, like a vending machine
         * Do not enter any other numbers or characters than those listed in the column
         * Enter the number when prompted and nothing else, i.e. "1", then hit enter

...after finishing the program executed in the previous step....

5) a) Tell an admin! If you made any changes, they are now queued up in the file "userSubmittedChanges.txt". They can be manually added by       a developer or admin with access to the DB.
       You're done here! 
       
...if you have permission to change DB...
    b) Navigate back to editPLOs folder where we were earlier and double click "userSubmittedChanges.txt"

6) Scroll to the bottom of "userSubmittedChanges.txt". Copy all the lines of your SQL command (I.e. UPDATE..Set..WHERE..AND...)

7) Go back to the user_guide folder and open up the advanced guide. 

8) Paste your SQL command copied from step 6 into the SQL tab

9) Done! Database should be updated with your change.
