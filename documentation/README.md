# SLOScraper

## Context

The SLOScraper is the Final Project for students enrolled in Butte College's Programming Project class for Fall 2020.

Course instructor: April Browne

## Purpose

The purpose of the SLOScraper is to scrape the Butte College website's [list of academic programs](https://butte.edu/academicprograms) for data and store it in an authoritative database.

For each program, we will collect:
* The program's name
* The program's type (AA, AS, CERT, etc.)
* The program learning outcomes (PLOs)

This information will then be sent to the database to be stored.

We intend to expand on the functionality above by implementing change tracking for SLOs and other features.

## Project Requirements

The Project Requirements Specification can be found [here](Requirements%20Specification.md).

## Installation

Our installation guide will be drafted when the program is installable.

## Code Documentation

Our documentation currently consists of this README, the [Requirements Spec](Requirements%20Specification.md) and the [Test Spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ErBFM63NGi1povpQOw0ebBLgK1uQZknqbO14v0YyjC8/edit)

## Usage

This program is to be used for keeping track of SLOs and PLOs. It is intended to be used by faculty and staff of Butte College. 

### User Base

The user base will consist mainly of department chairs and the PLO Coordinator.

### Expected Output

The program will use Bootstrap to display a user interface capable of CRUD actions against a PLO database.

### How to Use SLOScraper

A previous class used Python to scrape the site and store the data in a database. 
The starter code of that project was written and given to a previous class by Boyd Trolinger. The final version of that codebase can be found at SHA: [92cde62e](https://gitlab.com/stevenacorrea/fa20-cs36-project/-/tree/92cde62ec63e493cd3d665bf47d679ad044fec60). FA20 has decided to archive that project in favor of starting over from scratch using NodeJS.

Our instructor April Browne helped us apply development methodologies and best practices to this project.

## Project Status

As of this writing, the team is in the inital phases of planning, defining and designing the project.
