Overview:
The scraper populates the database from the butte college website.
A Discussion is generated from the web form which in turn creates an assessment for each learning outcome evaluated. Currently only programs and program outcomes will be present in the DB; other types may be entered in a later version.

Querying the Database:
 
Use Case #2: Access - Teacher report
Show all outcomes associated with one or more programs regardless of when they were assessed. Entries should be grouped by the program and ordered by the assessment date in descending order.
 
Use Case #3: Access - Chair report
Show all outcomes associated with one or more programs regardless of when they were assessed. Entries should be grouped by the program and ordered by the assessment date in descending order.
 
Use Case #5: Assess - Chair report
Show all programs and outcomes associated with a specified department. Entries should be grouped by the program and ordered by the assessment date in descending order.

The date an outcome was last evaluated can be determined by the date of the last discussion which assesses it or the plo_assess_date.

Ex.

Select the program name, outcome description, and date of discussion where the discussion was more than one month ago.

SELECT 
	poutcomes.pout_desc Program_Outcome,
	programs.prog_name Program, 
    discussions.discussion_date Evaluated_On
FROM poutcomes
JOIN programs ON programs.prog_id=poutcomes.prog_id
JOIN plo_assessments ON plo_assessments.pout_id=poutcomes.pout_id
JOIN discussions ON plo_assessments.discussion_id=discussions.discussion_id
WHERE discussions.discussion_date < DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH);
 
Updating and Inserting:
Use Case #7: Assessment Form Submission
Create an entry in the discussions table with data from the form. An assessment should be created for each outcome referenced in the form data.
