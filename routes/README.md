# WELCOME TO THE ROUTES FOLDER

This is where the server handles a request from the browser/client. 
Since everything is a get request theres no real need for controllers I think if you are familiar with MVC. 
So Whats happening?...

Starting from the top.

1. A request is sent to the server for a webpage, I will use the home route for this example.
2. The indexRoute picks that up in the server.js (server.use(indexRoute)) and executes its callback function that can be seen in routes/index.js
3. Looking at the callback function from routes/index.js, index.ejs is servered to the client via res.render method. 
4. Once the response is finished and the page is delivered, the nodejs server just chills and waits for something else to do or better yet another page request.
