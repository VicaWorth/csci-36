# Welcome to the VIEWS folder!

This folder handles all the html and css for the most part. It is using the template engine EJS which allows for more dynamic webpages. EJS adds the ability to inject content into the html from the server. So when we look at programs, each program is being injected in as if we were fetching them from an api. If you are familiar with ReactJs it kind of works like props in the sense you pass them in and they are rerendered each time the 'component' is called. If that doesnt make sense, take a peek at the programs route, the { programs: allPrograms } is an object being passed into the 'HTML' where the value is the object which was declared above. If you look at all_programs.ejs we can see it is being used with <%=> syntax to inject into the HTML with a loop for each program to generate all the programs.
