#WELCOM TO THE MODELS FOLDER!

Models are the frame for where we store the data. The models are made with javascript objects but they translate directly to mysql 'stuff'. 
When data is scraped it is stored in the database using these models.

Each file in this folder containts functions that create the models then exports them to be used in
other places of the program.
