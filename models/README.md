# WELCOME TO THE MODELS FOLDER! #

Models are JavaScript objects used to create, read, update, and delete from MySQL tables. They allow us to easily access data from the database without having use direct MySQL statements. Instead, we access the sequelize object. 

Each file in this folder creates a table in the database. Other parts of our program uses this model to get data from the database.
